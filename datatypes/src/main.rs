// Rust is a statically typed language, 
// which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile time. 

// Each signed variant can store numbers from -(2n - 1) to 2n - 1 - 1 inclusive, 
// where n is the number of bits that variant uses. So an i8 can store numbers 
// from -(27) to 27 - 1, which equals -128 to 127. Unsigned variants can store 
// numbers from 0 to 2n - 1, so a u8 can store numbers from 0 to 28 - 1, which equals 0 to 255.
